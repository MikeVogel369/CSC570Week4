fifties?) when spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nthe first iteration (the springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to max\\nfriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). the problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. the solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-springer motor (front)\\n                 viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nthis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. the engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nthe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\njust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. one side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. the solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. wimps).\\n\\ndespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. the solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. this\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nwith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / xx \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself. the bore curve would start\\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\\n                             this diagram\\n\\n\\nthe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\\nfinned viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. thus, the\\nname.\\n\\nthe vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\\ntechnology. eventually, it was dumped when spag finally realized that\\nracing was not where the spagthorpe name would be made. the machines\\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\\n(approximately six vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\\nspringers. confusing the issue is one old spag staffer who swears up and\\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. however, no modern\\nrecord of a production viking has survived, and most motorcycle\\nhistorians discount this story.\\n\\nryan cousinetc.|1982 yamaha vision xz550 -black pig of inverness|live to ride\\nkotrb          |1958 ajs 500 c/s -king rat                      |to work to\\ndod# 0863      |i\\'d be a squid if i could afford the bike...    |flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   vancouver, bc, canada   |live . . .\\n\\n\\n * slmr 2.1a * if you aren\\'t sliding, you aren\\'t riding.\\n                                                                                                          \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|computer dynamics bbs    604-255-9937(hst)    604-986-9937(v32)|\\n|vancouver, bc, canada -  easy access, low rates, friendly sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

(warning, non-numeric, non-\\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl. not\\nthat you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\\n\\noh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. ask the kotl in e-mail. you\\'ll\\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\\nnet, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too.\\n\\nby now you\\'re probably asking \"so who\\'s the kotl already?\". well, as\\njohn sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around\\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. first, it is not myself,\\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though john was\\nthe original kotl. second, in keeping with the true spirit of unix, the\\nkotl\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the kotl shares his name with a line-\\noriented text utility.) third, he has occasionally been seen posting\\nmessages bestowing new dod numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\\nmailers\"). fourth, there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a\\ndead-head.\\n\\n***************** newsflash: a message from the kotl ******************\\n\\nonce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\\ngroveled to the kotl, please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed\\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\\nsomething done.  your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  during such times of\\neconomic activity on the part of the kotl\\'s employers, sending yet\\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\\nexcersize for the reader).  if you suspect mailer problems, at least\\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\\nthe kotl *memorizes* the

0161)\\n\\n      [road rider, august 1991, reprinted with bruce\\'s permission]\\n\\nthere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \\nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  they discuss motorcycles and  \\nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \\nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \\ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \\nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  they \\nargue with each other and plan rides together.\\n\\nthe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \\nother face to face.  the members of this group live all over the known world \\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\\n\\nthe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \\nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  currently, \\nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for \\nthe group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \\nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  most of the frequent \\nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the denizens of doom, usually referred \\nto as the dod.\\n\\nthe dod started when motorcyclist john r. nickerson wrote a couple of \\nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  fellow computer \\nenthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"denizen \\nof doom.\"  a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr. 0003 keeper of \\nthe flame.  bruce was then designated dod nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \\ncourse, nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given dod nr. 0001.\\n\\nthe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \\nappealed to many, so john sloan -- dod nr. 0011 -- became keeper of the \\nlist, issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one.  to date there have been \\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the united states and \\ncanada, as well as australia, new zealand, the united kingdom, france, \\ngermany, norway and finland.\\n\\nkeeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch.  the initial run \\nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  the profits from this went to the \\namerican motorcycle heritage foundation.  another amhf fund raiser -- \\nselling denizens of doom pins to members -- was started by arnie skurow a \\nfew months later.  again, the project was successful and the profits were \\ndonated to the foundation.  so far, the denizens have contributed over $1500 \\nto the ama museum.  a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs \\nin the motorcycle heritage museum.\\n\\nas often as possible, the dod\\'ers crawl out from behind their crts and go \\nriding together.  it turns out that the two largest concentrations of \\ndod\\'ers are centered near denver/boulder, colorado, and in california\\'s \\n\"silicon valley.\"  consequently, two major events are the annual assault on \\nrollins pass in colorado, and the northern versus southern california \\n\"joust.\"\\n\\nthe ride-and-feed is a bike trip over rollins pass, followed by a big \\nbarbecue dinner.  the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern \\ncalifornia ride south; riders from southern california to ride north, \\nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  an additional plan \\nfor 1991 is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction \\nwith the ama heritage homecoming in columbus, ohio, in july.\\n\\nthough it\\'s a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective \\ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to \\nget together.  long may they flame.\\n\\n\\n\"live to flame -- flame to live\"\\t[centerbar]\\n\\nthis official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which \\nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \\nanything like that face to face.  these insults are known as \"flames\";  \\nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  flames often start when a member \\ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  a \\ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \\nsomething like:  \"what an incredibly stupid statement, you spandex-clad \\nposeur!\"  this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \\nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \\nability and your cat.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          _the denizens of doom: the saga unfolds_\\n\\n                  by john sloan  dod #0011\\n\\nperiodically the question \"what is dod?\" is raised. this is one of\\nthose questions in the same class as \"why is the sky blue?\", \"if there\\nis a god, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"why do\\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they\\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\\nhalls of academe for generations. \\n\\na long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\\nmachines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another\\nvia a system in chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\\nwho was eventually assigned the dod membership #1) wrote a satire of\\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\\nsigned it \"the denizen of doom\". not wishing to identify himself, he\\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\\nbecome dod #2 to post it for him. dod #2, not really giving a whit\\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\\nindividual, did so.  flaming and other amusements followed. \\n\\nhe who would become the holder of dod membership #3 thought this was\\nthe funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom\\nmotorcycle club, and started signing his postings with his membership\\nnumber. \\n\\nperhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\\nelectronically.  it may well be that readers were yearning to become a\\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\\nsum of its parts.  it could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who\\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\\nminded enough to accept us as members. \\n\\nin a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, the denizens of doom\\nmotorcycle club was born. a club in which the majority of members have\\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). a club organized\\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\\naround the country (organized by dod #9), club patches (organized by\\n#11), and even an mtv-style music video (produced by #47 and\\ndistributed on vhs by #18)! \\n\\nwhere will it end? who knows? will the dod start sanctioning races,\\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\\nmanagement computers? will the dod organize poker runs where each\\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\\nwill the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\\nroom and at least a 386-sized unix system? only time will tell. \\n\\nthe dod has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\\naccess and a love for motorcycles. to become a member, one need only\\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\\nreally good club secrets). new members will receive via email a\\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\\nincludes name, state, and email address. \\n\\nthe denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever (or at least\\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \\n\\n                  live to flame - flame to live\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n     the dod daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\\n\\n\\tchuck rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  dod

case you managed\\nto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the dod started\\nas a joke. and in the words of one denizen, it intends to remain one.\\n\\nsometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"what does dod\\nstand for? it\\'s not the department of defense is it?\" naturally, a\\ndenizen who had watched the movie \"top gun\" a few times too many rose\\nto the occasion and replied:\\n\\n\"that\\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\\'d have to kill you.\"\\n\\nand the rest is history.\\n\\na variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\\nwhat dod stands for. notable contributions (and contributers, where\\nknown) include:\\n\\ndaughters of democracy (dod 23)\\t\\tdoers of donuts\\ndancers of despair (dod 9)\\t\\tdebasers of daughters\\ndickweeds of denver\\t\\t\\tdriveway of death\\ndebauchers of donuts\\t\\t\\tdumpers of dirtbikes\\n\\nnote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\\nlimited only by the contents of one\\'s imagination or dictionary file.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                     the rec.moto.photo archive\\n\\nfirst a bit of history, this all started with ilana stern and chuck\\nrogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. many copies were made,\\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\\nunknown locations. then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate\\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. bruce has not\\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\\n\\nnot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\\nat their motorcycles. a few non-photo files are available from the\\nserver too, they include the dod membership list, the dod yellow pages,\\nthe general rec.motorcycles faq, and this faq posting.\\n\\nhere are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how\\nto use the archive.\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nvia ftp:\\n\\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\\n\\nvia e-mail:\\n\\nthe address is server@cerritos.edu.  the commands are given in the body of the\\nmessage.  the current commands are dir and send, given one per line.  the\\narguments to the commands are vms style file specifications.  for\\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [dod]file.  for example, you can send:\\n\\ndir [dod]\\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\\n\\nand you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ascii.\\n\\noh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\\nthe next whole file) are send.  a \\'send [dod]*.gif\\' would send 150 files of\\n50k each; not a good idea.\\n-- \\nbruce tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    tanner@cerritos.edu\\ncerritos college    norwalk, ca

rec.moto.photo archive useful?\\nsecond, since bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\\nof you to access it after normal working hours (california time). \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      patches? what patches?\\n\\nyou may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches &\\npins. and your reaction was probably: \"i want!\", or \"that\\'s sick!\", or\\nperhaps \"that\\'s sick! i want!\"\\n\\nwell, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. the good news is that\\nthere\\'s been an amazing variety of dod-labeled widgets created. the bad\\nnews is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. this isn\\'t\\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\\n\"dod store\" that keeps a stock. all of the creations have been done by\\nindividual denizens out of their own pockets. the typical procedure is\\nsomeone says \"i\\'m thinking of having a dod frammitz made, they\\'ll cost\\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the ama museum. anyone want one?\" then\\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). so if you want a\\ndod doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. or\\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\\nthis is anarchy in action.\\n\\nhere\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known dod merchandise (and\\nperpetrators). patches (dod#11), pins (dod#99), stickers (dod#99),\\nmotorcycle license plate frames (dod#216), t-shirts (dod#99), polo shirts\\n(dod#122), zippo lighters (dod#99) [ltf ftl], belt buckles (dod#99), and\\npatches (dod#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\\npopular demand].\\n\\nall \"profits\" have been donated to the american motorcyclist association\\nmotorcycle heritage museum. as of june 1992, over $5500 dollars has

(yes i know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\\n\\n-----------------------------edward walsh----hewlett-packard company-------\\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  disk memory division, ms475\\n                             (208)323-2174   p.o. box 15  boise,idaho 83707\\n                             89fj1200;82xz550rj(vision);75guzzi850-t;dod#98\\n\\n-----------------------------edward walsh----hewlett-packard company-------\\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  disk memory division, ms475\\n                             (208)396-2174   p.o. box 15  boise,idaho 83707\\n                             89fj1200;82xz550rj(vision);75guzzi850-t;dod#98\\n\",\n",

(i\\'ve had people try to dismount\\n\\t  in traffic, just as i\\'m pulling in to a parking space!)\\n\\t- muffler gets hot! (\\'nuff said)\\n\\t- we get *good* traction.  we\\'re not going to fall over.  (many\\n\\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\\n\\t- turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\\'re sitting upright and\\n\\t  we\\'re going straight.  trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\\'re\\n\\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\\n\\t  of it.  or just hug me tight.  \\n\\t- please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \\n\\t  gradual, so i can compensate.\\n\\t- your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\\n\\t- trust is essential.  trust the driver (me) to do the right \\n\\t  thing -- i\\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\\n\\t  to operate it.  enjoy the ride.  (this is important to\\n\\t  stress.  for example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \\n\\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  i drove her to the beach down 84, \\n\\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\\'d holler, \"slow down! i\\'m scared\" \\n\\t  i humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \\n\\t  the spare piece of duct tape i keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\\n\\t  problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\\n\\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  based on her\\n\\t  experience driving a lincoln continental, she was unwilling to \\n\\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\\n\\nusually i\\'ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \\ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\\nhelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\\n\\nwatch out for gravel on the mt. hamilton road:  there were lots of little\\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\\nit doesn\\'t help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \\nfirst trip!\\n\\ngood luck -- have fun!\\n--\\ndon\\'t drink soap! dilute dilute! ok!\\n',\n",
